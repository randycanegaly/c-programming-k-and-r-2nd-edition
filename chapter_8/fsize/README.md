I found out that the code in K&R pages 179 to 184 is out of date wrt modern Unix/Linux and system versions. 
The recommendations I saw are to skip this section of the book. There was mention there of POSIX (???).
I need to study that. Maybe I will understand more after studying some more recent C code books that
are about "Modern C".

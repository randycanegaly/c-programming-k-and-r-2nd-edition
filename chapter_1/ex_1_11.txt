The tests that I would do and the inputs that would best uncover bugs:
- one input, new line only
- one word, with newline
- space only, then newline
- tab only, then newline
- a series of words with spaces separating them
- a series of words with tabs separating them
- a series of words with a mix of spaces and tabs separating them
- no input, just EOF
- some spaces, then a word
